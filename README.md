# Utils.js

A functional general purpose utility library consisting of a few functions which
I use in almost any front end javascript project.

## Usage

Install it for your project via npm:

```sh
  npm i -S git+https://git@github.com/nathamanath/utils_js.git
```

Then import it:

```js
  //es6
  import {$} from 'utils_js'
  let el = $('some_id')
  ...
```

### Docs

You can build the docs with `npm run docs`
